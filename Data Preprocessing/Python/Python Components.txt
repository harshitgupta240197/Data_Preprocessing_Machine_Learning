PYTHON MAJOR COMPONENTS:

        1. Class : A class is the model, or a blueprint, of something we want to build. 
                For example, if we make a house construction plan that gathers the instructions on how to build a house, 
                then this construction plan is the class.



        2. Object : An object is an instance of the class. 
                    So if we take that same example of the house construction plan, then an object is simply a house. 
                    A house (the object) that was built by following the instructions of the construction plan (the class).
                    And therefore there can be many objects of the same class, because we can build many houses from the construction
                    plan.



        3. Method : A method is a tool we can use on the object to complete a specific action. 
                    So in this same example, a tool can be to open the main door of the house if a guest is coming. 
                    A method can also be seen as a function that is applied onto the object, takes some 
                    inputs (that were defined in the class) and returns some output.



# Classic wayy of handling missing data is to replace the missing data with the average of all the values.


# We have to apply FEATURE SCALING after SPLITTING the data into TRAINING and TEST sets.


# Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. 
  If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but 
  unknown values. Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR (Support Vector for Regression) and 
  Random Forests Regression.
